## Maarten Slebos
I'm an indie dev from The Netherlands who taught himself how to code by following TheOdinProject curriculum. 

I encorporated AI into my workflow early on, which allows me to quickly hack together projects. 

## Projects 
### <ins>NoSkip</ins>
NoSkip is an app that I built to keep people accountable in the gym with a financial incentive. 

### <ins>EU Now</ins>
EU now is an app on iOS, Android & Web which aims to bring transparency to the EU. It scrapes all the latest data from the European Council, European Commission, European Parliament, and Council of the European Union. It leverages AI to automatically generate news articles. The app displays these articles in a very modern and sleek looking UI / UX experience. 


### <ins>StartStack</ins>
StartStack is an app boilerplate with Supabase for auth and db, and Revenuecat already set up.
Also a landing page for the app built with NextJS & Tailwind. Optimized for conversion and rapid iteration.
