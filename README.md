## Maarten Slebos
I'm an indie dev from The Netherlands who taught himself how to code by following TheOdinProject curriculum. 

I encorporated AI into my workflow early on, which allows me to quickly hack together projects. 

## Projects 
### <ins>NoSkip</ins>
[NoSkip](https://noskip.app) is an app that I built to keep people accountable in the gym with a financial incentive. 

### <ins>StartStack</ins>
StartStack is an app boilerplate with Supabase for auth and db, and Revenuecat already set up.
Also a landing page for the app built with NextJS & Tailwind. Optimized for conversion and rapid iteration.
